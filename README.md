Solutions for the adventofcode2015

These are by no way the best solutions. This is just me practicing using Python and sharing my code. Some of the solutions will be really bad but a few may be elegant.

There's no code solution for Day 11 because it's so easy to solve without coding.

I got stuck on Day 19 Part 2, went looking for help and straight up found a solution. Added some of my thoughts to the solution but I don't know if I would have worked it out myself in the end, probably due to a lack of familiarity with Python still.
